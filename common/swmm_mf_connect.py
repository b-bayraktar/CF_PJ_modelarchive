def intersect_points_grid(sim_ws=None, swmm_pth=None, pts_pth=None, grid_poly=None, n_junctions=12, crs='epsg:4456'):
    '''
    Intersects specified points with a grid polygon and retrieves information about junctions.

    This function reads point data from a specified shapefile, samples a given number of junctions,
    and intersects these junctions with a provided grid polygon. It then retrieves the corresponding
    SWMM node information, including invert elevations, and returns the number of junctions sampled,
    a dictionary of cell IDs, a dictionary of SWMM nodes, and a dictionary of invert elevations in feet.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    sim_ws : str
        The workspace directory containing the MODFLOW 6 simulation files. If None, the function will
        attempt to load from the current working directory.
    swmm_pth : str
        The file path to the SWMM input file. If None, a default path is used.
    pts_pth : str
        The file path to the shapefile containing point data. If None, a default path is used.
    grid_poly : GeoDataFrame
        A GeoDataFrame representing the grid polygon to intersect with the points.
    n_junctions : int
        The desired number of junctions to sample from the point data. Default is 12.
    crs : str, optional
        The coordinate reference system (CRS) to assign to the GeoDataFrame. Default is 'epsg:4456'.

    Returns:
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing:
        - n_junctions (int): The number of junctions actually sampled.
        - junctions (list): List of selected junction names.
        - mf6_cells (dict): A dictionary mapping junction names to their corresponding cell IDs.
        - swmm_inverts (dict): A dictionary mapping junction names to their invert elevations in feet.
